# Terminal Themes

Shellwright supports multiple color themes for screenshots and recordings. Set the theme when starting a session:

```json
{
  "command": "bash",
  "args": ["--login", "-i"],
  "theme": "dracula"
}
```

Or prompt your agent to use a specific theme, e.g:

> Create a shell recording of how to list files and folders and search for text, use the 'nord' theme.

## Tips

- Use `dracula` or `nord` for a more vibrant dark look
- The default `one-dark` works well for most cases
- Different sessions can use different themes simultaneously
